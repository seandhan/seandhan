<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Sean Dhanasar</h1>

## About Me

As a process engineer with substantial data experience, I'm now pivoting my career into data analytics. 

Throughout my engineering career, I've worked extensively with process data where I developed inferential soft sensors and model predictive controllers for automating and optimising live process plants. As I yearn to further expand my knowledge and expertise into data-driven initiatives I am committed to bridging the gap between my technical foundation and the evolving landscape of data analytics. This transition represents the fusion of my engineering background with advanced analytical capabilities. My GitHub showcases personal analytics projects I've built using Python, R, SQL, and more. I'm eager to leverage my expertise to drive innovation, facilitate transformative change, and make a significant impact on business challenges. 

I'm excited to join a team where I can continuously grow as a data analyst. Feel free to check out my projects!
